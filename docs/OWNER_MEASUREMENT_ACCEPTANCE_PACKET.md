# Owner measurement and validation acceptance packet

**Status:** `[SIMULATED OWNER DECISION — REQUIRES AARON REVIEW]` and
`[REAL-WORLD VALIDATION REQUIRED]`; no metric, target, participant protocol, or
analytics reuse is approved by this document
**Authority:** [Business Plan V2](../../00_source/BUSINESS_PLAN_V2.md) governs; its
numeric targets and commercial expectations remain hypotheses
**Related:** [Owner release decisions](OWNER_RELEASE_DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md) and
[findings ledger](FINDINGS_RETEST_LEDGER.md)

`[SUPPORTED BY BUSINESS PLAN V2]` Roadmap is a self-serve B2B SaaS for individual
instructors. Measurement must separate real self-service from founder assistance,
and it must not confuse a golfer's external coach-package action with a sale processed
or proven by Roadmap.

## Current candidate boundary

The current recorded candidate is owner-private Sites version 8 at source/runtime
release `cf117fef8ea42272d0b7e2358fe4197c024f86a7`, saved version
`appgprj_6a76957326fc819196ebf3a0c95f1ec3~appgver_01ba2d860b508191b4d104339921606d`,
deployment `appgdep_6a775b172534819196391fd626e95aa3`, and environment
revision `10`. Its local release archive is 2,963,266 bytes with gzip SHA-256
`99d615410c2e145e77938f0c5df4449ab8aeb4a544a5c5949fcdafa56a8e1378`;
the Sites content hash is
`sha256:9a4119ea60dd64d2a0bf14a55c7e2d27fb3e8ea250f0d064e8bc5a79fb34a87c`.
Sites version 7 remains historical predecessor evidence and is not an ordinary
rollback target after consent-governed use.

The exact-v8 automated suite passed 226/226 tests, but no authenticated browser
journey, manual accessibility review, authorized real instructor/golfer protocol,
or real-world measurement exists. Signed-out requests to `/`, `/app`,
`/api/health`, and `/api/operations/health` all returned the outer owner-policy
`401`; the bounded error-filtered Worker sample contained one expected non-owner
`/app.rsc` `403` with outcome `ok`, not a crash. No exact-v8 mounted-browser or
renderer inspection exists because the browser backend was unavailable. Deep
readiness remains intentionally degraded because approved consent-policy and
data-request-operator configuration is absent. None of these observations measures
activation, usability, reliability over time, support burden, accessibility, or
participant outcomes. This packet records no owner acceptance and authorizes no
participant, analytics, public-access, or commercial activity.

## Recommended measurement dictionary

Definitions below are proposed for owner review; no numeric success threshold is
approved. Denominators, eligibility, time windows, and cohort exclusions must be
frozen before observing results.

| Measure | Exact proposed definition | Truthful boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Activation | Eligible instructor creates an account/profile, activates a current package/external action, completes and previews one adult golfer roadmap, publishes it, and creates a private share capability | `[SIMULATED OWNER DECISION — REQUIRES AARON REVIEW]`; capability creation is not message delivery or golfer use |
| Human-free activation | Activated instructors with no scheduled onboarding or founder completion divided by activated instructors | Reactive support and every intervention minute/reason are reported separately; assisted activation is not self-serve evidence |
| Time to activation | Elapsed active task time from first authenticated product use to activation, with idle time and assistance rules frozen | No target is approved; speed must not override roadmap quality, consent, accessibility, or coach judgment |
| Share reliability | Valid capabilities successfully exchanged and rendered, segmented from invalid/expired/revoked/rate-limited/error outcomes | Operational health, not proof of golfer comprehension or delivery through the instructor's channel |
| Instructor return/update | Activated instructors who return and make an intentional lesson/practice/evidence/phase update in the defined window | Update count alone does not prove value or coaching outcome |
| Support dependence | Operator minutes and contacts per account, by activation/identity/billing/data/privacy/product reason and assisted-research status | Founder research is reported separately but never hidden to improve self-serve claims |
| Golfer agency/trust | Approved participant task/retell plus pressure, clarity, confidence, correction, sharing-context and decline-choice responses | Requires consented real-world research; no sentiment is inferred from clicks |
| SaaS commercial state | Activated paid instructors, full-price paid months, cohort MRR, cancellation/pause/reactivation and support/cost by cohort | `[PRICING HYPOTHESIS — REQUIRES VALIDATION]`; measure only after exact offer/policy and authorized billing exist |
| External coach action interest | Explicit user handoff initiation, if approved and disclosed | Not a booking, purchase, revenue, conversion, or instructor fulfillment event; never scrape the destination |
| Reliability guardrails | Error/recovery rate, broken shares, security/privacy/access/deletion incidents, billing faults, accessibility blockers, support escalation | A positive growth metric never overrides a guardrail or unresolved serious harm |

Business Plan V2's activation, seasonal revenue, support, conversion, payback,
retention, and reactivation targets remain `[UNVALIDATED BUSINESS ASSUMPTION]` or
simulated choices. Do not import those numbers into dashboards, release criteria, or
public claims until Aaron approves exact definitions and real evidence supports them.

## Data-minimizing collection rules

- First-party audit events are accountability records, and provider logs are
  diagnostics; neither becomes product analytics merely because it exists.
- Approve each measurement purpose, field, retention period, access role, and
  deletion/export behavior before real-user collection.
- Never collect raw capability tokens/fragments, cookies, SIWC headers, narrative
  roadmap content, full external URLs, payment details, webhook bodies, or secret values.
- Prefer event-family/status/timestamp/release and pseudonymous tenant identifiers;
  suppress small cohorts where reporting could identify a person.
- Keep participant identity/consent and raw qualitative material outside the source
  repository in an approved restricted system.
- Record founder assistance, recruitment source, season, assessment opportunity,
  instructor experience, package context, device/accessibility needs, outages, and
  other confounders rather than attributing every result to Roadmap.
- Do not contact participants, change public access, use real golfer data, send
  messages, or create a live charge without `OWNER-VALIDATION-001` and applicable
  policy/consent/operator authority.

## Protocol fields Aaron must approve

| Field | Required decision |
|---|---|
| Purpose and decisions | Which product/commercial question each measure can change; prohibited secondary use |
| Participants and access | Adults-only inclusion/exclusion, recruitment, compensation, owner-only/allowlist/public boundary |
| Stages/cohorts | Assisted research, assisted beta, true self-serve, paid operation; acquisition source and seasonal cohort |
| Eligibility and windows | Signup/activation denominator, opportunity criteria, observation dates, idle/duplicate/test-account rules |
| Assistance | What counts as onboarding, reactive support, founder completion, and research facilitation |
| Policy/consent | Exact privacy/terms/research/recording versions, instructor authority for golfer records, withdrawal and contact routes |
| Collection/retention | Event dictionary/version, data map, access, storage, suppression, retention/deletion and export handling |
| Analysis | Predefined calculations, missing data, confounders, qualitative method, limitations; no post-result threshold invention |
| Guardrails/stop triggers | Security/privacy/billing/accessibility/trust/support/data-loss conditions that stop collection or operation |
| Owners | Validation lead, privacy lead, support/incident route, analyst/reviewer and Aaron's decision authority |

## Viable decisions

1. Approve a controlled adults-only, no-live-charge protocol after policy, consent,
   operators, collection fields, and stop triggers are exact.
2. Approve a later bounded paid protocol only after billing prerequisites and a
   maximum authorized transaction/refund scope are exact.
3. Keep operation synthetic/owner-only and defer real-world claims.

**Recommendation:** begin with choice 1 and the minimum events needed to measure
self-serve activation, support dependence, share reliability, and trust guardrails.
Do not introduce third-party analytics by default. Defer revenue attribution,
seasonality, retention, and coach-package outcome claims until the necessary time
window and data quality exist.

This packet does not itself authorize participants or external effects. Pair the
approved dictionary with the exact `OWNER-VALIDATION-001` wording in
[owner release decisions](OWNER_RELEASE_DECISIONS_REQUIRED.md). Final release
acceptance remains separate under `OWNER-ACCEPT-001`.
