# Owner residual-risk acceptance packet

**Status:** `[OWNER INPUT REQUIRED]`; candidate risks, not accepted risks
**Purpose:** Record informed, bounded, time-limited acceptance for one exact release
**Related:** [Findings ledger](FINDINGS_RETEST_LEDGER.md),
[security/privacy](SECURITY_PRIVACY.md), and
[provider/exit record](PROVIDER_RESPONSIBILITY_COST_AND_EXIT.md)

A residual risk is what remains after implemented controls and applicable evidence
pass. Missing evidence, an unresolved critical incident, unknown customer harm, or a
policy decision that has never been made is not made safe by calling it residual.

## Current candidate scope

These candidate risks are reconciled to owner-private Sites version 7 at
source/runtime release `7ed01ec822fdb5c2bfbe6db7e3c99bcba126ac17`, local package
SHA-256 `a07f06989d3ba6cf05b924b149fc9f955be512223c6f90d5dd8d7628d175e526`,
Sites content hash
`sha256:4a00694b9798f4f84487e8e7ea224703ccbbfc61a32dd132d417dc65b7f153bc`,
saved version `appgprj_6a76957326fc819196ebf3a0c95f1ec3~appgver_55fe270d85f081919dcd346c8476130d`,
deployment `appgdep_6a772e0616b88191972b4e2e0603da52`, and environment
revision `9`. Sites version 6 remains historical predecessor evidence. This
identity record does not accept a risk or authorize public, real-user, or paid use.

## Required risk record

| Field | Required value |
|---|---|
| Risk ID and exact release/scope | Stable ID; commit, archive, environment, access/feature boundary |
| Evidence-based scenario | Threat/failure, affected actors/data/operation, current controls and control evidence |
| Rating | Likelihood and impact before/after controls; rationale, not just a colour |
| Alternatives | Remediate, reduce scope/disable feature, transfer, avoid, or accept |
| Decision | Chosen treatment and why the expected benefit justifies remaining harm |
| Accountability | Named owner, due/review date, monitoring signal, mitigation action |
| Stop/revisit trigger | Exact event/threshold that disables the operation or reopens the decision |
| Aaron acceptance | Decision ID, exact wording/date/conditions; no inferred approval |

## Candidate residual risks requiring disposition

Ratings below are recommendations for review, not Aaron's decisions.

| Risk | Proposed residual rating | Implemented containment/evidence | Required disposition and trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RR-CSP-001`: vinext bootstrap currently requires CSP `'unsafe-inline'` for script elements | Medium | Exact v7 passed automated adversarial coverage; framework escaping, raw HTML/SVG exclusion, URL/input controls, no `unsafe-eval`, and inline script-attribute denial are implemented. No supported-browser deployed-CSP inspection exists. | Security owner reviews exact deployed CSP/test evidence. Revisit on vinext nonce/hash support, any XSS finding, CSP regression, or runtime change. |
| `RR-CAP-001`: an intended golfer can forward a bearer capability | Medium | 256-bit verifier, HMAC fingerprint at rest, fragment/body exchange, short scoped session, neutral failures, expiry, rotation/revocation, no third-party analytics | Accept only after hosted exchange/revoke/session tests and approved sharing copy. Stop on token logging, cross-golfer access, unexplained forwarding harm, or inadequate revocation. |
| `RR-PROVIDER-001`: Sites/Worker, SIWC, D1/R2, and deployment/control-plane concentration increases provider-exit impact | Medium | Versioned source/migrations, logical recovery path, immutable internal instructor IDs, private object metadata, and exact v7/v6 artifacts are recorded. Local recovery passed, but no hosted rollback, restore, or portability exercise exists. | Name owner and portability cadence. Revisit on terms/region/support/cost/recovery failure, unsupported runtime, or failed export/restore/portability exercise. |
| `RR-EXTERNAL-001`: Roadmap cannot verify the instructor's external booking/purchase/contact destination or outcome | Medium | HTTPS validation, preview, explicit leave-site warning, separate SaaS billing, no sale/booking attribution, visible ask/wait/decline choices | Confirm truthful copy and support owner. Stop on unsafe/misleading destination reports, pressure pattern, or user belief that Roadmap processed the coach transaction. |

## Items not currently eligible for residual-risk acceptance

- `SEC-001` exposed SIWC bypass credential before rotation/revocation and retest;
- missing hosted identity/spoof/recovery evidence before public authentication;
- missing qualified privacy/legal, retention/deletion, and public-copy decisions
  before real customer/golfer data;
- missing manual accessibility review where an undiscovered blocker may exist;
- missing hosted rollback/restore, alert, scheduler, incident, and staffed-operator
  evidence for the affected operating scope;
- missing billing policy/configuration/webhook/controlled-transaction evidence before
  paid operation; and
- missing authorized real-account journeys and Aaron's exact-release acceptance.

These items may be resolved, avoided by keeping the affected operation disabled, or
reassessed after evidence exists. Owner silence is not acceptance.

## Viable decisions

For each eligible `RR-*` item, Aaron may accept for an exact bounded scope and period,
require further mitigation/evidence, disable the affected feature/access scope, or
reject the release. **Recommendation:** keep acceptance narrow, name one operator,
set the earliest practical review date, and choose triggers that can actually be
observed and acted on.

## Exact proposed decision wording

> `OWNER-RISK-001`: For Roadmap release **[candidate/commit/archive]** operating as
> **[scope]**, I reviewed residual risks **[RR IDs and record version]** on **[date]**.
> I accept only **[IDs]** at ratings **[ratings]** because **[evidence-based rationale]**.
> **[name]** owns each mitigation and monitoring action **[actions]**. Review on
> **[date]**. Stop or reopen the release on **[exact triggers]**. Risks **[IDs]** are
> not accepted and require **[remediation, evidence, or disabled scope]**. This does
> not waive a critical finding, qualified review, public/billing/retention decision,
> real-account authorization, or `OWNER-ACCEPT-001`.

Record the signed wording in the repository decision log without rewriting earlier
history. Link the exact risk version and release evidence. If scope, provider,
configuration, policy, migration, or finding changes materially, the acceptance no
longer covers the new state until explicitly renewed.
